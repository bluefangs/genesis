# Introduction to Frontend Development

## Overview

This documentation provides comprehensive guidelines for frontend development in our Next.js project. Our approach emphasizes:

- Server-first development with Next.js
- Type safety with TypeScript
- Component-based architecture with React
- Performance optimization
- Quality and maintainability

## Core Principles

### 1. Server-First Approach
- Server-side rendering by default
- API routes through Next.js
- Secure data handling

### 2. Code Quality
- Maximum file size: 300-350 lines
- Clear component structure
- Comprehensive testing
- Detailed documentation

### 3. Performance
- Local dependency management
- Optimized builds
- Regular performance monitoring
- Core Web Vitals optimization

### 4. Development Experience
- Clear coding standards
- Efficient workflow
- Comprehensive tooling
- Regular feedback cycles

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **UI Components**: ShadCN
- **State Management**: React Context + Hooks
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Build Tools**: Built-in Next.js tooling
